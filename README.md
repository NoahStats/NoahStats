My name is Hangil Hong, and I am an undergraduate researcher in quantitative psychology.
My interests lie in the theory and application of Bayesian statistics and point process modeling.

I am currently conducting research on the application of Bayesian nonparametric methods (e.g., Gaussian Processes) and point-process models for behavioral science data, under the guidance of Dr. Kazuya Fujita.

Previously, I completed a research project on multilevel modeling, where I extended mixed-effects location–scale models and applied the framework to real-world data under the supervision of Dr. Kazuhiro Yamaguchi at the University of Tsukuba.

I am also interested in broader areas of statistics and data science beyond psychology, including theoretical statistics, spatial statistics, time-series analysis, and causal inference.

To prepare for graduate-level study in statistics, I have completed over 40 credits of coursework in mathematics and engineering at the University of Tsukuba.
Although the university does not currently offer double majors or minors, I will be graduating with a B.A. in Psychology.

Coursework: 
Calculus, Linear Algebra, Measure Theory, Introduction to Topology, Differential Equations,
Applied Mathematics (Fourier Analysis, Laplace Transformations), Applied Probability,
Psychometrics (Item Response Theory), Introduction to Econometrics
