## Hi there 👋

<!--
**NoahStats/NoahStats** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am currently doing a research on the theory and application of Bayesian statistics and point-process modeling, applying nonparametric Bayesian methods and probabilistic models for behavioral science, under the guidance of Dr.Kazuya Fujita.

I have conducted a research project on multilevel modeling, extending mixed-effects location–scale models and analyzing real data within this framework, under the supervision of Dr. Kazuhiro Yamaguchi at the University of Tsukuba.

I am both intersted in the theoretical statistics and the application in quantitative psychology. 

Coursework: Calculus, Linear Algebra, Measure Theory, Introduction to Topology, Differential Equations, Applied Mathematics (Fourier Analysis and Laplace Transformations), Applied Probability, Psychometrics (Item Response Theory), and Introduction to Econometrics
