# 👋 Hi!
My name is Hangil Hong and I am an undergraduate researcher in the field of quantitative psychology.  
I prefer to be addressed as Noah in English!

## 🎯 Interests
My current interests lie in the theory of Bayesian statistics and point processes and their applications to behavioral science.  
I am also interested in broader areas of statistics beyond their applications to psychological sciences, namely theoretical statistics, spatial statistics, time series analysis and causal inference.

## 🔬 Research Experiences
I am currently carrying out research applying Bayesian nonparametrics (e.g. Gaussian Processes) and point-process models to behavioral science data, under the guidance of Dr. Kazuya Fujita at the University of Tsukuba, Japan.

I previously completed a research project on multilevel modeling, extending mixed-effects location–scale models and analyzing real data within this framework, under the supervision of Dr. Kazuhiro Yamaguchi at the university.

## 📚 Relevant Coursework in Math
To prepare for graduate-level study in statistics, I have completed over 40 credits of coursework in mathematics and engineering at the University of Tsukuba.  
Unfortunately, the university does not currently offer double majors or minors. I will be graduating with a B.A. in Psychology.

**Coursework:**  
Calculus, Linear Algebra, Measure Theory, Introduction to Topology, Differential Equations,  
Applied Mathematics (Fourier Analysis, Laplace Transforms), Mathematical Statistics, Applied Probability,  
Psychometrics (Item Response Theory), and Introduction to Econometrics
